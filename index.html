			<h4>Who is this women? <strong>Dreamer, Creative</strong> or <strong>Super Designer</strong>...</h4>
			
			<p>My name is Thalia Bacilio and I am 25 years old. At first, I intended to be a publicist when I was studying advertising in Mexico; however, my studies were interrupted when I moved to Toronto. There, I worked as volunteer designing flayers, invitations, logos, brochures for my Christian church PIAH for almost three years. It was then that I realized that I wanted to become a graphic designer and to have my own company. A company that shares the word of God (Holy Bible) through innovative design. Later, I got married, moved to Ottawa and started my graphic design program at Algonquin College. Meanwhile I am studying, I am currently available for freelance work. I specialize in Print Design, Photography & Branding, so feel free to contact me at any time on any issue such as:</p> 
			
				<ul>
					<li>"I want to increase the quality of my brand."</li>
					<li>"I need some promotional material (business cards, flyers, postcards, labels,etc)."</li>
					<li>"I want unique concepts for my company."</li>
					<li>"I am stressed out from not having creative ideas."</li>
				</ul>

For example, London tower, bus, suitcase, cemetery, museums, airplane and main characters (Ambrose and her wife Zipper). Besides, the street names are some key words of this book that helps the reader to know what is the story about. King cool KC (handwriting font) is used for the book title and author name, which describes the new personality of Ambrose (playful, attractive and youthful). The chosen colours represent the three main countries in the story, London, Amsterdam and Zanzibar.</p>
